## Overview

This template provides a simple busybox container running `sleep infinity` as a Monk runnable. You can:

- Run it directly as a long-running placeholder container for testing
- Inherit it in your own runnable to create custom utility containers based on busybox

It's particularly useful for debugging Monk deployments, testing connectivity, or serving as a lightweight base container that stays running indefinitely.

## What this template manages

- Busybox container (`busybox` image, latest tag)
- Long-running sleep process that keeps the container alive
- Minimal resource footprint

## Quick start (run directly)

1) Load templates

```bash
monk load MANIFEST
```

2) Run the infinite sleep container

```bash
monk run infinity/base
```

3) Or run the 30-second sleep variant

```bash
monk run infinity/sleep30
```

The `base` runnable will stay running indefinitely, while `sleep30` will exit after 30 seconds.

## Configuration

This template uses minimal configuration:

```yaml
containers:
  utils:
    image: busybox
    image-tag: latest
    bash: sleep infinity  # or "sleep 30" for the sleep30 variant
```

No variables are exposed by default, but you can customize by inheritance.

## Use by inheritance (recommended for custom utilities)

Inherit the base runnable to create custom utility containers. Example:

```yaml
namespace: myapp
debug:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: infinity/base
  containers:
    utils:
      bash: |
        echo "Starting debug container"
        sleep infinity
```

Or create a custom initialization script:

```yaml
namespace: myapp
init:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: infinity/base
  containers:
    utils:
      bash: |
        # Run initialization tasks
        wget -O /tmp/config.json http://config-server/config
        # Then sleep to keep container running
        sleep infinity
```

Run your custom utility:

```bash
monk run myapp/debug
```

## Use cases

This template is useful for:

- **Testing deployments**: Verify that Monk can deploy and run containers
- **Network debugging**: Keep a container running to test connectivity between services
- **Placeholder services**: Temporarily replace a service while debugging
- **Base for custom utilities**: Inherit and add custom scripts or initialization logic
- **Learning Monk**: Simple template to understand Monk fundamentals

## Variants

- `infinity/base`: Runs `sleep infinity` indefinitely (marked as private, intended for inheritance)
- `infinity/sleep30`: Runs `sleep 30` and exits after 30 seconds

## Related templates

- Use as a base for custom initialization or sidecar containers
- Combine with other templates to add debugging capabilities to your stack

## Troubleshooting

- Check container logs:

```bash
monk logs -l 500 -f infinity/base
```

- Exec into the running container for debugging:

```bash
monk shell infinity/base
```

- The container uses minimal resources, so if it fails to start, check general Monk connectivity and cluster status
